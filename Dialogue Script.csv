1,1,1,1,He's a boy; a strong one.,Doctor,Hospital_V01
2,2,1,2,Simon… he’s my Simon.,Mother,Hospital_V01
3,1,1,1,We should have hired someone for this.,Mother,OldHouse_V02
4,2,1,2,Do you know how much that costs? No thank you.,Father,OldHouse_V02
5,1,1,3,"Ah, there, there. Don't you worry, little guy. We're here for you",Mother,OldHouse_V02
6,2,1,4,This family is the best thing that's ever happened to me.,Father,OldHouse_V02
7,1,1,5,Someone's sentimental...,Mother,OldHouse_V02
8,2,1,6,"Hey, it's the truth! I just hope he’s going to feel the same way.",Father,OldHouse_V02
9,1,1,7,He will.,Mother,OldHouse_V02
10,1,1,1,Don't forget to take notes! I'll help you go through them when you come back home.,Mother,School_V03
11,2,1,2,I won't forget!,Simon,School_V03
12,3,1,3,"If there's a problem, just ask the teacher to call us",Father,School_V03
13,2,1,4,"Don’t worry, dad. I'll be fine!",Simon,School_V03
14,1,1,5,See? He says he'll be fine,Mother,School_V03
15,3,1,6,"*Sigh* Alright. Just take care. I’ll see you later, son!",Father,School_V03
16,2,1,7,Later!,Simon,School_V03
17,1,1,1,"Still waiting, huh?",Julia,School_V04
18,2,1,2,They'll be here soon. What about you?,Simon,School_V04
19,1,1,3,"My parents are always late, but yours are usually the first to get here.",Julia,School_V04
20,1,1,4,"Or so I've noticed, anyway.",Julia,School_V04
21,2,1,5,"Huh? Yeah, I guess. They don't like me staying out here for long, especially in the winter.",Simon,School_V04
22,1,1,6,That sure doesn't seem to be the case today.,Julia,School_V04
23,2,1,7,"Well, maybe something came up, I don't know. I don't mind waiting.",Simon,School_V04
24,1,1,8,I'm just teasing you. I kinda hate having to wait for them every day.,Julia,School_V04
25,2,1,9,Haven't you gotten used to it by now?,Simon,School_V04
26,1,1,10,"Funnily enough, no. I see everyone going home early with parents who seem to care, to a home they seem to love. That sure as heck isn't me.",Julia,School_V04
27,2,1,11,I think it's easy to judge others when you don't know what they're really like.,Simon,School_V04
28,1,1,12,Meaning?,Julia,School_V04
29,2,1,13,"Well, nobody's perfect, you know?",Simon,School_V04
30,2,1,14,"I'm sure your parents wish they could pick you up early every day. That's what I'd want to do, at least.",Simon,School_V04
31,1,1,15,"Yeah, that's a nice dream. I doubt my parents care that much about me.",Julia,School_V04
32,2,1,16,"Even if they don't, someone will. We all get our chance to be cared about.",Simon,School_V04
33,1,1,17,"Again, that's a nice dream... But I hope you're right.",Julia,School_V04
34,1,1,1,"Welcome, Julia! I hope you feel right at home.",Mother,OldHouse_V05
35,2,1,2,"Hello, Mr. and Ms. Wright. Thanks for having me!",Julia,OldHouse_V05
36,3,1,3,"Oh, please, just call me Joseph. Mr. Wright is my-",Father,OldHouse_V05
37,4,1,4,Don't you dare...,Simon,OldHouse_V05
38,1,1,5,"So, you're the Julia I've been hearing all about? You're such a dolly! I love the dress.",Mother,OldHouse_V05
39,2,1,6,"Thank you so much, Miss. It's my mother's dress. She insisted on me wearing it today.",Julia,OldHouse_V05
40,1,1,7,"Well, I think it looks gorgeous on you! Don't you think so, Simon?",Mother,OldHouse_V05
41,4,1,8,"Uhm, sure. It looks pretty nice on her",Simon,OldHouse_V05
42,1,1,9,But don't say it to me!,Mother,OldHouse_V05
43,2,1,10,*Chuckles*,Julia,OldHouse_V05
44,4,1,11,Can we go eat now? Dinner's gonna get cold.,Simon,OldHouse_V05
45,3,1,12,Boy's got a point. I'm starving.,Father,OldHouse_V05
46,4,1,13,You're always starving.,Simon,OldHouse_V05
47,1,1,14,That he is.,Mother,OldHouse_V05
48,1,1,1,"Hey, everything alright? You disappeared back there.",Julia,School_V06
49,2,1,2,I just wanted some air. I'm not good at these kinds of events.,Simon,School_V06
50,1,1,3,Are you good at any kind of event?,Julia,School_V06
51,2,1,4,...,Simon,School_V06
52,1,1,5,"You know I'm just messing with you, dummy. To be honest, I felt pretty awkward, too.",Julia,School_V06
53,2,1,6,Then why did you bother coming? We should have stayed home.,Simon,School_V06
54,1,1,7,I came because I wanted this. I wanted to share it with you. This is the last chance we’ll get.,Julia,School_V06
55,2,1,8,What do you mean?,Simon,School_V06
56,1,1,9,"Well, school is over. Everyone else spent their days having fun, doing all sorts of crazy stuff. Us? We’re out here. I thought maybe that’s what I needed. Maybe if I go out and have a nice, traditional school prom, I'd know what the rest feels like.",Julia,School_V06
57,2,1,10,So is that it? Am I that boring?,Simon,School_V06
58,1,1,11,"No, you know that's not what I mean.",Julia,School_V06
59,2,1,12,"I know. I'm just messing with you, dummy.",Simon,School_V06
60,1,1,13,...,Julia,School_V06
61,2,1,14,It’s crazy to think high school is over. It doesn’t feel that way.,Simon,School_V06
62,1,1,15,I still feel like just a kid. My parents would probably agree.,Julia,School_V06
63,2,1,16,"Hey, how about we go back inside?",Simon,School_V06
64,1,1,17,Hmm? I thought you weren't good at events like these.,Julia,School_V06
65,2,1,18,"Yeah, but what kind of boyfriend would take her girl to a prom without asking for a dance?",Simon,School_V06
66,1,1,1,Did you tell your parents yet?,Julia,Park_V07
67,2,1,2,"No, not yet. I’m waiting for the right moment.",Simon,Park_V07
68,1,1,3,And when exactly is that going to be?,Julia,Park_V07
69,2,1,4,"Honestly, I don’t know. They might have figured it out already.",Simon,Park_V07
70,2,1,5,You don’t start packing unless you plan to leave.,Simon,Park_V07
71,1,1,6,All the more reason to tell them.,Julia,Park_V07
72,1,1,7,"It’s not like they’ll get mad, you know? It’s only natural after college.",Julia,Park_V07
73,2,1,8,"They’ve always wanted me to keep the house, but I can’t force them to move like that.",Simon,Park_V07
74,1,1,9,"So, you won’t. They’ll understand. There’s no need to get worked up about it, goof.",Julia,Park_V07
75,2,1,10,I genuinely hope you’re right.,Simon,Park_V07
76,1,1,11,When am I not right?,Julia,Park_V07
77,2,1,12,Good question. I’ll get back to you on the answer.,Simon,Park_V07
78,1,1,13,...,Julia,Park_V07
79,2,1,14,Speaking about answers…,Simon,Park_V07
80,1,1,15,"Wow, that was such a smooth transition, there.",Julia,Park_V07
81,2,1,16,Did you give it any more thought?,Simon,Park_V07
82,1,1,17,"Look, you know what my parents think about us moving together before marriage. I don’t want to leave and make things even worse than they already are.",Julia,Park_V07
83,2,1,18,"I know, but still. It feels like it’s about time. I don’t want to move to an empty room when I know you’re still waiting.",Simon,Park_V07
84,1,1,19,"I get that, and I feel the same, but you know they-",Julia,Park_V07
85,2,1,20,"I want to wake up with you by my side. I want to see that smile of yours every day, glad to know I can help it shine. Honored to know you’re letting me help it shine.",Simon,Park_V07
86,1,1,21,Simon…,Julia,Park_V07
87,2,1,22,I want to help you find that something. I want to become that someone who deserves you.,Simon,Park_V07
88,1,1,23,"God, I can’t believe you.",Julia,Park_V07
89,2,1,24,I want to be your chance to be cared about. Will you let me?,Simon,Park_V07
90,1,1,1,"Dear family and friends, we are here today to witness and celebrate the union of Simon Wright and Julia Peterson in sacred matrimony.",Pastor,Church_V08
91,1,1,2,"True love is rare. It remains hidden, often forgotten, trapped in the deepest depths of the sea. But we are gathered as proof that Simon and Julia have found it.",Pastor,Church_V08
92,1,1,3,"May their story, still untold, be a beacon of inspiration. May the journey that is married life be their greatest one yet.",Pastor,Church_V08
93,1,1,1,Is there anything left in the car?,Simon,NewHouse_V09
94,2,1,2,"Nope, I double-checked.",Julia,NewHouse_V09
95,1,1,3,Great. Moving all of those gifts over was too much of a hassle.,Simon,NewHouse_V09
96,2,1,4,I didn't even think my parents would give us anything.,Julia,NewHouse_V09
97,1,1,5,"I was more surprised that your mom came to me and asked if I was sure I was making the right choice, heh.",Simon,NewHouse_V09
98,2,1,6,Don't even. She asked because of what I said when you proposed.,Julia,NewHouse_V09
99,1,1,7,Did you tell her about that?,Simon,NewHouse_V09
100,2,1,8,"Once she saw the ring, there was no escape. When I told her about it, she started laughing *so* hard.",Julia,NewHouse_V09
101,1,1,9,I wasn't laughing.,Simon,NewHouse_V09
102,2,1,10,"Hey, you gotta admit it was pretty funny! And it was your fault for putting me on the spot like that.",Julia,NewHouse_V09
103,1,1,11,"But seriously, ""Good question, I'll get back to you on the answer""?!",Simon,NewHouse_V09
104,2,1,12,*Chuckles* It never gets old.,Julia,NewHouse_V09
105,1,1,13,Unlike me. I seem to be aging by the minute ever since we moved here.,Simon,NewHouse_V09
106,2,1,14,"I, for one, couldn't be happier. A house, a car, a loving husband, a stable job... It's pretty much all that anyone could ever wish for.",Julia,NewHouse_V09
107,1,1,15,That's a decent wishlist. Is there space for a vacation in it?,Simon,NewHouse_V09
108,2,1,16,"Yep, and we better take advantage of it while it lasts. Someday I doubt we'll have the time.",Julia,NewHouse_V09
109,1,1,17,I'm still not sure...,Simon,NewHouse_V09
110,2,1,18,"Look, I'm not saying it has to be anytime soon, but it's something I really want.",Julia,NewHouse_V09
111,1,1,19,"It's not that. I definitely want it, but I'm not sure I'm ready. I don't know if I'll ever be, honestly.",Simon,NewHouse_V09
112,2,1,20,"And you think I feel ready? I'd be completely terrified. But I know things will end up okay. You'll be the dumb but amazing dad, and I'll be the kick-ass mum.",Julia,NewHouse_V09
113,1,1,21,You sound awfully confident.,Simon,NewHouse_V09
114,2,1,22,"I read a quote once. ""Everything will be okay in the end. If it isn't okay, it isn't the end"". I know it's unrealistic, but I like to think it's true. That even if everything goes wrong, we can still rest assured we'll be okay.",Julia,NewHouse_V09
115,1,1,23,"You know, you've gotten a lot more positive compared to high school. I like to think I had something to do with that.",Simon,NewHouse_V09
116,2,1,24,"Oh? Someone's got an ego. I won't offer a response to your comment, mister.",Julia,NewHouse_V09
117,1,1,25,That said… I hope kids like dumb but amazing dads.,Simon,NewHouse_V09
118,2,1,26,You bet they do..,Julia,NewHouse_V09
119,1,1,1,"She's a beautiful girl, miss.",Doctor,Hospital_V10
120,2,1,2,"Lace, Just like her grandma.",Julia,Hospital_V10
121,1,1,1,Do I really have to go alone? Can't you come with me?,Lace,School_V11
122,2,1,2,"Big girls can go to school on their own, can't they?",Simon,School_V11
123,1,1,3,Yeah but...,Lace,School_V11
124,3,1,4,"Hey, don't worry. We'll be here to pick you up as soon as it's time to go back home.",Julia,School_V11
125,1,1,5,Right here? You promise?,Lace,School_V11
126,3,1,6,I promise we'll be waiting for you!,Julia,School_V11
127,1,1,7,Alright... I think I'm ready.,Lace,School_V11
128,2,1,8,"We'll see you soon, sweetie. Have a good day!",Simon,School_V11
129,1,1,9,"Bye mom, bye dad!",Lace,School_V11
130,3,1,10,"Goodbye, little birdie!",Julia,School_V11
131,1,1,1,I just saw another one!,Lace,Park_V12
132,2,1,2,Oh yeah? Was it pretty?,Julia,Park_V12
133,1,1,3,"Yeah, it was yellow. I think it had some red as well.",Lace,Park_V12
134,3,1,4,Our professional birdwatcher strikes again!,Simon,Park_V12
135,1,1,5,Not even. I left my binoculars and camera at home.,Lace,Park_V12
136,2,1,6,I told you to pack them up before breakfast.,Julia,Park_V12
137,1,1,7,I couldn't find them! We haven't come here in forever.,Lace,Park_V12
138,2,1,8,You should have told me! I think they're in the basement.,Julia,Park_V12
139,1,1,9,They shouldn't be in the basement... We used to come here every week.,Lace,Park_V12
140,3,1,10,"Sweetie, we've talked about it. I've been busy at work, and you know your mother hasn't been feeling well. We'll try to come more often, but it isn't for sure. It's out of our hands.",Simon,Park_V12
141,1,1,11,"Yeah, I know... I just really wish we could. I loved coming here to just watch the birds and hang out.",Lace,Park_V12
142,2,1,12,I remember you saw a red bird once and thought it was a Phoenix.,Julia,Park_V12
143,1,1,13,"Oh, mom, that was ages ago.",Lace,Park_V12
144,2,1,14,"Yeah, but your father here pretended it really was. You went to school excited to tell your friends about the Phoenix bird you saw.",Julia,Park_V12
145,3,1,15,Was I supposed to break her heart? She looked so thrilled.,Simon,Park_V12
146,2,1,16,"You weren't supposed to encourage her, that's for sure.",Julia,Park_V12
147,1,1,17,"It's not like any of my friends believed me, anyway. The teacher explained it all to me afterward.",Lace,Park_V12
148,3,1,18,"See? No harm, no foul. I get the cool dad points with none of the drawbacks.",Simon,Park_V12
149,2,1,19,"Gosh, you're such a...",Julia,Park_V12
150,1,1,20,...Mom? Are you okay?,Lace,Park_V12
151,3,1,21,Julia?!,Simon,Park_V12
152,1,1,1,"Name, Julia Peterson. Time of death, 2:13 am. Cardiac arrest. I'll tell the family.",Doctor,Hospital_V13
153,1,1,1,"We honor a woman who changed many lives. We will stop to hear the stories, to laugh and cry as we remember with our hearts, and mourn with our eyes. Julia made an impact on this world. The fact that we are here is proof of that. May her memory be carried on by those who knew her, and by those fortunate enough to have loved her.",Pastor,Cemetary_V14
154,2,1,2,Dad…,Lace,Cemetary_V14
155,3,1,3,Lace?,Simon,Cemetary_V14
156,2,1,4,"She left, dad… She left me. She’s not coming back. I’m alone.",Lace,Cemetary_V14
157,3,1,5,"Look, I’m right here with you.",Simon,Cemetary_V14
158,2,1,6,You’re not her.,Lace,Cemetary_V14
159,1,1,1,There you are. Are you okay?,John,School_V15
160,2,1,2,What do you care? It was your friend who did that number back there.,Lace,School_V15
161,1,1,3,"Yes, I know Elisa can be a handful, but she's good at heart.",Jogn,School_V15
162,2,1,4,"Believe me, I know her all too well. I doubt she even has a heart.",Lace,School_V15
163,1,1,5,"Look, I'm here to apologize. What she did was wrong, and there's no excuse. I didn't stop her. I really didn't think she would take it that far, especially not today.",John,School_V15
164,2,1,6,"Taking it far is what she does best. Ever since high school started, she's made it her mission to make my life impossible. Safe to say she has won.",Lace,School_V15
165,1,1,7,"But why, though? Is it just because of your mother? She doesn't pick fights with anyone else, just you.",John,School_V15
166,2,1,8,Aren't I the lucky one? It probably started because I stopped hanging out with her after what happened. Now? I don't even know why she bothers. Maybe she just finds it funny.,Lace,School_V15
167,1,1,9,Didn’t your dad try to do something? Maybe transfer?,John,School_V15
168,2,1,10,"He came here to complain after a teacher told him what was happening. You know how this stuff works. Her family helps the school a lot. And my dad can barely pay for this, so transferring wasn’t an option.",Lace,School_V15
169,1,1,11,"Well- Uh, sorry, it’s like I’m interrogating you. It just doesn’t feel fair that you had to go through all of that. I had no idea it was that bad.",John,School_V15
170,2,1,12,"It’s okay, you’re not the first one to ask. I had a lot of discussions with my dad about this, about how I should talk to her and fix things up. It just never seemed realistic. There wasn’t much anyone could do. She hates me and that’s that.",Lace,School_V15
171,1,1,13,"I could have tried to help if I knew. It just seemed like fun and games from my perspective. Maybe your dad was right. Maybe if you talked with her, things would have gotten better.",John,School_V15
172,2,1,14,"Like I said, she hates me and that’s that. My dad just said whatever would make it seem like he cared.",Lace,School_V15
173,1,1,15,What are you talking about?,John,School_V15
174,2,1,16,"Look, I didn’t come out here looking for conversation.",Lace,School_V15
175,1,1,17,"I’m sorry… I’m just trying to get to know you better, for what that’s worth. If you don’t want to answer, that’s completely okay.",John,School_V15
176,2,1,18,"*Sigh* Well, things between me and dad weren’t the same after my mom died. I guess he tried being there for me, but I shut down. I didn’t know what I was supposed to do without her. In middle school, I was just one more student. When I started high school, I was the girl with the dead mom. I distanced myself, and he started doing it as well. Maybe I gave him no choice.",Lace,School_V15
177,1,1,19,That sounds… Very rough. I can’t even think of anything to say. I’m sorry you had to go through all of that.,John,School_V15
178,2,1,20,"You keep apologizing, but you haven’t done anything wrong. If anything, well, I guess I’m glad you came looking for me. I’d probably be home by now, otherwise.",Lace,School_V15
179,1,1,21,"Hey, it was the least I could do after what happened. I imagine you weren’t planning on getting questioned by a guy you barely know.",John,School_V15
180,2,1,22,"Hmm, no, I do know you. You’re the red hair guy.",Lace,School_V15
181,1,1,23,"Oh, for crying out loud. That was a single week!",John,School_V15
182,2,1,24,Hehe. I got you mad.,Lace,School_V15
183,1,1,25,"Well, at least I’m not the Phoenix girl.",John,School_V15
184,2,1,26,W- what?! You know about that?,Lace,School_V15
185,1,1,27,I’ve got my ways of getting inside information around the school.,John,School_V15
186,2,1,28,"Pfft. Yeah, right.",Lace,School_V15
187,1,1,29,"Speaking about school, what do you plan to do now?",John,School_V15
188,2,1,30,Hmm?,Lace,School_V15
189,1,1,31,"You know, since it’s all over. I plan to work at my dad’s store until I start college, and there I’ll probably study education. How about you?",John,School_V15
190,2,1,32,"Well, I’ll likely move to an apartment by next year. I’ve been working on a side job for a few months, so I can afford it if I go full-time.",Lace,School_V15
191,1,1,33,"Woah, you’ll just leave your house like that?",John,School_V15
192,2,1,34,"I already told my dad about it. He didn’t seem to mind, or at least he didn’t tell me if that was the case.",Lace,School_V15
193,1,1,35,Still… That’s a big jump.,John,School_V15
194,2,1,36,"It’s nothing I’m not prepared to do. Even if I fail, I’ll just get up and try again. That’s how you improve; you get up and keep going.",Lace,School_V15
195,1,1,37,Hmm. Nice words to live by. I truly hope it goes well for you.,John,School_V15
196,2,1,38,Thanks. I hope so as well.,Lace,School_V15
197,1,1,1,"No, that part was pretty straightforward. I just took the test.",Lace,Park_V16
198,2,1,2,And the car?,Simon,Park_V16
199,1,1,3,Loan. There wasn’t much left with the apartment bills and all.,Lace,Park_V16
200,2,1,4,I can’t believe you managed all of that on your own.,Simon,Park_V16
201,1,1,5,"What, weren’t you sure I’d be able to make it?",Lace,Park_V16
202,2,1,6,"I was very sure, but it still feels like it was yesterday that you needed me to cook for you. It’s a bit hard to digest the fact you’re a grown woman now, and a darn amazing one at that.",Simon,Park_V16
203,1,1,7,"Heh, for what it’s worth, it’s thanks to you that I’m even standing here in the first place. Even after she was gone, you did all you could.",Lace,Park_V16
204,2,1,8,If only that had been enough…,Simon,Park_V16
205,1,1,9,Dad…,Lace,Park_V16
206,2,1,10,It’s okay. We both know it wasn’t. You left the house for a reason. I’m just happy that you grew strong enough to do it.,Simon,Park_V16
207,1,1,11,"I left because I wanted to take control of my life, not because I thought you weren’t doing enough. You worked really hard for us for so long.",Lace,Park_V16
208,2,1,12,"I was doing it for you. As long as you could have all that you needed, nothing else mattered.",Simon,Park_V16
209,1,1,13,I did. You even bought those new binoculars when I asked if we could go birdwatching to the reserve.,Lace,Park_V16
210,2,1,14,"We never went, did we?",Simon,Park_V16
211,1,1,15,"No, but I brought them today. I thought we could watch them here, just like we did back then.",Lace,Park_V16
212,2,1,16,Just like when your mother was here.,Simon,Park_V16
213,1,1,17,What do you think she’d say today? What would she think about us?,Lace,Park_V16
214,2,1,18,"I think she’d be really proud of her daughter, and the woman she has become. Just as proud as I am.",Simon,Park_V16
215,1,1,19,Yeah… That’s what I thought as well.,Lace,Park_V16
216,2,1,20,"So, are you still dating that John guy?",Simon,Park_V16

220,2,1,24,Wow… That’s… A lot.,Simon,Park_V16
221,1,1,25,I wanted to tell you in person and also just chat for once. He proposed to me last week. I'm moving over to his house after the wedding.,Lace,Park_V16
222,2,1,26,This John guy… Are you sure?,Simon,Park_V16
223,1,1,27,"If I wasn’t sure, I wouldn’t have said yes, you know. It’s sudden, but you’ve talked to him before. You said you liked him.",Lace,Park_V16
224,2,1,28,"Yeah, as your boyfriend! I didn’t think you’d end up marrying the guy!",Simon,Park_V16
225,1,1,29,Dad.,Lace,Park_V16
226,2,1,30,"Okay, sorry. I know it’s your choice, I’m not going to go against it, I’m just trying to process this.",Simon,Park_V16
227,1,1,31,"It’s okay, I understand.",Lace,Park_V16
228,2,1,32,I can’t believe this is gonna happen already. Her little birdie is gonna get married.,Simon,Park_V16
229,1,1,33,Except I’m not so little anymore.,Lace,Park_V16
230,2,1,34,"To your mother, it didn’t matter how old you got, or how bigger you seemed to grow. You’d always be her precious little birdie.",Simon,Park_V16
231,1,1,1,"John Coleman, do you take this woman to be your wife, to love her, to honor her, to comfort her, to face life with her, and to keep her in sickness and in health, against all tribulation, for as long as you both shall live?",Pastor,Church_V17
232,2,1,2,I do.,John,Church_V17
233,1,1,3,"Lace Wright, do you take this man to be your husband, to love him, to honor him, to comfort him, to face life with him, and to keep him in sickness and in health, against all tribulation, for as long as you both shall live?",Pastor,Church_V17

235,1,1,5,I now pronounce you husband and wife.,Pastor,Church_V17

243,4,1,8,I'm glad they get along well.,John,Park_V18
244,3,1,9,"If my dad's good for anything, it's spoiling a kid. Not that I complained.",Lace,Park_V18
245,4,1,10,"Haha, that's clear enough. But you should give him more credit, Joe loves him.",John,Park_V18
246,3,1,11,"Yeah, he's been good to him. He told me he's planning to buy Joe an actual soccer set this Christmas. Goalposts and all.",Lace,Park_V18
247,4,1,12,Huh? Where would we even set that up?,John,Park_V18
248,3,1,13,No clue. I guess we could bring it when we come to the park... This is why I wanted a house with a yard.,Lace,Park_V18
249,4,1,14,"Are you still worked up about that? You know yards don't take care of themselves, right?",John,Park_V18
250,3,1,15,The same could be said about you.,Lace,Park_V18
251,4,1,16,Uncalled for. I quite frankly feel offended.,John,Park_V18
252,3,1,17,"That was my intention. But seriously, now, what do you think about that gift?",Lace,Park_V18
253,4,1,18,How so? It sounds like a really nice gift. You know how much Joseph loves soccer.,John,Park_V18
254,3,1,19,"Yeah... What I mean is, he's really trying to be a part of his life. We've been bringing Joe here a lot and my dad has been coming as well. I guess I'm just really happy to see him like this.",Lace,Park_V18

256,3,1,21,"Oh, yeah...",Lace,Park_V18
257,4,1,22,Isn't that a good thing?,John,Park_V18
258,3,1,23,"It is. It feels... Like something I lost long ago is back. Like this feeling that I didn't even know was missing has returned. I still hope to get even closer, maybe even make up for all of the time we lost.",Lace,Park_V18
259,4,1,24,"Honestly, It makes me really happy to hear you say that. One of my wishes was to help you fix things up with your dad.",John,Park_V18
260,3,1,25,"Well, you certainly helped. I know I’m not the most receptive person out there, so, thank you.",Lace,Park_V18
261,4,1,26,Your happiness is all of the thanks I need. How about we join those two?,John,Park_V18
262,3,1,27,"Oh, I’m gonna kick your butt.",Lace,Park_V18
263,4,1,28,You're on.,John,Park_V18
264,1,1,1,"Every life on Earth is like a river. Some rivers extend into the sea, while others end sooner than we’d like. Every one of them, however, leaves a trail behind. This trail can be memories, regrets, or pain, or hope.",Pastor,Cemetary_V19
265,1,1,2,"What the trail represents depends entirely on us. Is it a stream of possibilities and fears? Or a straight line of reality? Whatever the case might be, the trail will stay with us even after the river is gone.",Pastor,Cemetary_V19
266,1,1,3,"Simon Wright lived a life of joy and happiness. Of grief and regret. Of love and acceptance. May his trail stay with us, as a reminder that nothing is beautiful because it lasts, but because it leaves a lasting impact on us.",Pastor,Cemetary_V19
